# World-Happiness-Report

This project was part of my data analysis course at CareerFoundry to learn exploring relationships, geographical visualizations  with Python, supervised machine learning (Regression) 
and unsupervised machine learning (Clustering). 
My role was to build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results ofan advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.
Following analyses were conducted throughout this achievement:

● Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots, and
categorical plots);

● Geospatial analysis using a shapefile;
● Regression analysis;

● Cluster analysis;

● Time-series analysis;

● Analysis narrative and final results (presented in your dashboard).
