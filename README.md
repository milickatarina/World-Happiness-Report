# World-Happiness-Report

This project was part of my data analysis course at CareerFoundry to learn exploring relationships, geographical visualizations  with Python, supervised machine learning (Regression) 
and unsupervised machine learning (Clustering). 
My role was to build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results ofan advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

Following analyses were conducted throughout this achievement:

● Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots, and
categorical plots);

● Geospatial analysis using a shapefile;
● Regression analysis;

● Cluster analysis;

● Time-series analysis;

● Analysis narrative and final results (presented in your dashboard).

## About the project

World Happiness Report

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. It ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness.The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

## Project's key questions and objectives

● Which country has the highest happiness score, and which one has the lowest?

● What is the average happiness score in the world?

● Which continent has the highest happiness score?

● Is there any correlation between freedom and happiness score?

● Which country has the highest perceptions of government corruption, and which one has the lowest?

● Is there correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy?

## Data limitations

Data limitations: Happiness is a feeling and subjective measure and it’s very challenging to express it in numbers or scale it. Every individual is different and different things bring us joy and happiness. Also, people in different parts of the world have different mentalities, way of life, culture and religion and happiness on that national level differs much. 
The last dataset is from 2019. Since then, the world has changed, especially since Covid-19. I believe that people have different perspectives of happiness in general.

## Retrospective

I chose this dataset because it seems very interesting, and it looks like something I would enjoy analyzing and learning about.
This analysis can be relevant not only in political, economical and sociological  field, but also in psychology, psychiatry, or medicine and the results could be used to improve people's lives around the world.
